# Raspberry-Pi-0W-Rocket-Project
Public Repo for the 'Flying Ostrich' flight computer and programs that go along with it.

The Flying Ostrich is the rocket me, and three other kids are working on to begin learning about engineering. This is a good challenge for my Python skills as it needs to adjust to different supplied conditions. 

PROGRESS REPORT: Scrubbed today due to hardware limitations. In testing limits were exceeded and at launch site the signal blacked out at half the tested range. The rocket made it to the pad but never took off. Unfortuinately if these issues can not be fixed there will have to be a retirement or a redesign.

Updates:
- Working on in-body testing and range testing, packet sending should be fine providing launch goes according to plan and datais correct (5/29/2021)
- Everything in place for launch, testing underway and launch still set for June 12th-13th weather permitting (5/30/2021)
- Scrubbed launch today due to unexpected hardware limitations, read progress report for in-depth. (6/12/2021)
- Waiting for altimeter to arrive so we can test with it, this will involve new code but will most likely work for the rocket (6/30/2021)
- Altimiter should arrive by next Thursday, wiring and testing will be later that week/early that next week (6/21/2021)

GO FOR LAUNCH JUNE 12-13!!! (Weather permitting)
