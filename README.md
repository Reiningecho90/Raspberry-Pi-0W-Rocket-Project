# Raspberry-Pi-0W-Rocket-Project
Public Repo for the 'Flying Ostrich' flight computer and programs that go along with it.

The Flying Ostrich is the rocket me, and three other kids are working on to begin learning about engineering. This is a good challenge for my Python skills as it needs to adjust to different supplied conditions. 

PROGRESS REPORT: Scrubbed today due to hardware limitations. In testing limits were exceeded and at launch site the signal blacked out at half the tested range. The rocket made it to the pad but never took off. Unfortuinately if these issues can not be fixed there will have to be a retirement or a redesign.

Updates:
- First test code finished, going to put the code onto the flight cpomputer as soon as possible to start testing (6/28/2021)
- Added the failsafe, program can not run on windows machine so migration will be later today or tomorrow (6/28/2021)
- Posting code to github so I can transfer to Pi (6/29/2021)
