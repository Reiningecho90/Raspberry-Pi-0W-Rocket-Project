# Raspberry-Pi-0W-Rocket-Project
Public Repo for the 'Flying Ostrich' flight computer and programs that go along with it.

The Flying Ostrich is the rocket me, and three other kids are working on to begin learning about engineering. This is a good challenge for my Python skills as it needs to adjust to different supplied conditions. 

Updates:
- Final launch prep is underway, finishing up the rocket this week maybe
- Upper stage being finished today, with all flight hardware installed, lastly nosecone ballast (4/46/2021)
- Upper stage finished yesterday (4/26/2021) as all electronics are almost finished and ready for flight (4/27/2021)
