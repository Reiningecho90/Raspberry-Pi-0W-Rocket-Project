# Raspberry-Pi-0W-Rocket-Project
Public Repo for the 'Flying Ostrich' flight computer and programs that go along with it.

The Flying Ostrich is the rocket me, and three other kids are working on to begin learning about engineering. This is a good challenge for my Python skills as it needs to adjust to different supplied conditions. 

Updates:
- Projected launch day change, now looking at 15-16 of May rather than the 11th due to scheduling with launch club
- Backup launch day chosen, Jun 12-13
- Launch club website: https://mdrocketry.org/
- Added changes to deploy program, starting testing once everything can get attached to the rocket
- Looking to hold off camera due to how packed the bay is currently, may try to make space in the future
- Ribbon for camera delivered, testing soon
- As mentioned on the issues page, the firsts tests for the deployment were succesful
- Added camera script (launch-record.py)
- Started new pull request, move scripts to main for ease of access
