# Raspberry-Pi-0W-Rocket-Project
Public Repo for the 'Flying Ostrich' flight computer and programs that go along with it.

The Flying Ostrich is the rocket me, and three other kids are working on to begin learning about engineering. This is a good challenge for my Python skills as it needs to adjust to different supplied conditions. 

PROGRESS REPORT: All systems are now functioning properly and are go for alunch June 12th-13th providing all next tests go to plan (fairly lenient testing although launch configuration tests will be conducted). All data reception was sub-optimal although limiting factor was not processing power, but mostly the lack of datarate through Modem firewall.

Updates:
- Working on in-body testing and range testing, packet sending should be fine providing launch goes according to plan and datais correct (5/29/2021)
- Everythin in place for launch, testing underway and launch still set for June 12th-13th weather permitting (5/30/2021)

GO FOR LAUNCH JUNE 12-13!!! (Weather permitting)
