# Post Testing Review for 4/20/2021 Deployment Sequencing Tests

## Goals for testing:

- Provide vital information on flight readiness
- Provide information on area of parachute bay
- Gain understanding of physical mechanics for parachute deploy
- Test under harsh conditions (ballistic speed, freefall, stationary)

### Expected results:

- Successful test of parachute deployment sequence at count +167-168
- Successful deploy of bottom cover, with target velocity (1 or more m/s)
- Successful rotation of servo, and good data from flight system
- No overheat damage from battery, data unit or flight computer

#### Actual Results:

- Deployment sequence commenced at precisely count +168, following data reading
- Bottom cover deployment at ~6ft/s or ~1.8m/s stable, testing not done in harsh conditions, or on ballistic due to lack of time
- Servo rotation successful to 190Â° follow through, MPU6050 data was inverted due to improperly placed data unit. G values were constantly -1z meaning drift was minimal on unit, and data was in fact useable to the computer.
- Battery skin peeling from mounting method, easy fix implemented, no other damage to systems. Post-test boot successful.
